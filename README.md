This repository contains the SQL queries and report I created for an individual assignment completed as part of the MScBA in Business Analytics & Management program (September - October 2023). The project, undertaken for the Data Management & Ethics course, aimed to analyze the impact of Airbnb on Parisian neighborhoods and recommend ethical data management practices in the context of hospitality data.

# Project overview
The project was comprised of several stages:
1. Data Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing of Airbnb data to ensure accuracy and reliability in subsequent analyses.
2. Database Implementation: Designing and setting up the database schema using SQL, including an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and ensuring normalization (NF) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
3. Querying and Reporting: Developing SQL queries to extract insights such as listings distribution, pricing trends, host registration patterns, and distribution of listings per host.
4. Report Preparation: Summarizing findings, discussing methodology, and presenting recommendations in a comprehensive report.

# Files
This repository contains the following files:
- **Data processing.sql**: SQL script detailing the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- **Database implementation.sql**: SQL scripts for setting up the database schema and relationships.
- **Querying and reporting.sql**: SQL queries used to extract and analyze data related to Airbnb impact on Parisian neighborhoods.
- **Report.pdf**: Final report encompassing project methodology, findings, and ethical considerations.

Due to its size, the database itself was too large to upload to GitHub, even when compressed.

# Results
The project identified significant insights into the distribution of Airbnb listings across neighborhoods in Paris, pricing patterns, and host behaviors. These findings contribute to understanding the broader implications of short-term rental platforms on urban environments and highlight the importance of ethical data management practices in handling hospitality data.
